# Customer Loss Prediction for a Telecommunications Company Using Machine Learning
It costs more for businesses such as telecommunication companies to acquire new customers compared to retaining existing ones. This impacts the operating costs within the company. The aim of this report is to take a sample set of customer churn data and produce an optimal model for predicting whether or not a customer will leave the company. The chosen dataset has 3333 rows and 21 features, one of which is the class attribute “Churn”. Python’s Scikit-learn library was used to produce a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a Decision Tree classifier.
